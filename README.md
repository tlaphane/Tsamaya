# Tsamaya

For majority of public transport users, the lack of convenient access and knowledge to a variety of 
of transport modes is an issue,resulting in inefficient and costly travel experiences.

## What is our solution?

Our solution is to provide commuters with information so that they can plan their trips efficiently. 
The South African transport industry contains insufficient information across these three 
predominant modes of transport. Our solution aims to optimize the system by enabling commuters 
to plan their trip with ease and account for safety travels
